<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm a professional, responsible for working on both front-end and back-end
  development processes. I design, develop, and maintain fully-fledged and
  functioning platforms with databases or servers. These servers do not need
  other third-party applications, I build an entire system from scratch.

<p>
  I describe myself as hard-working and driven individual who isn't afraid to
  face a challenge. I'm passionate about my work and I know how to get the job
  done. I would describe myself as an open and honest person who doesn't believe
  in misleading other people and tries to be fair in everything I do.
